##pinWorks
This is my location sharing social media application, which allows for location based communication.
It is a passion project that I work on whenever I get time. And as with most personal projects, this isn't as often as I would like.

The three second summary would be:
  ```
    Place a pin where you are, attach a message, and decide who can see it.
  ```

#Possible use cases
